Hello, thanks for checking out my repo.

The rings have a inner diameter of 26mm / 1,02362 inch, while the XLs have 50mm / 1,9685 inch

For the printing I use my roommates Bambu Lab P1S, with the 0.4 Nozzle and AMS, to get the text on the rings in white, while each effect get's a different base color.
To get the rings looking nice, I let the printer iron each top surface and use a small layer height.

The ring storage is just printed with the standard "0.20mm Strenght" setting.

I will be adding lots of effects (mainly for Dungeons & Dragons).

Use and modify to your own liking!
